The python notebook explains all the code really really well and I'd recommend looking at it, because that's where I wrote documentation as I was coding things up.

The sections are super easy to follow so you should have no problem seeing all of my code. The functions you ask us to implement are almost always at the start of each section. The only note is that most stuff with the exceptions of sharpening and multi-scale images expect a greyscale image and could fail if given a multi-channel image
