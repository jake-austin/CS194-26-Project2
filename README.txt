The python notebook explains all the code really really well and I'd recommend looking at it, because that's where I wrote documentation as I was coding things up.

The sections are super easy to follow so you should have no problem seeing all of my code. The only note is that most stuff with the exceptions of sharpening and multi-scale images expect a greyscale image.
